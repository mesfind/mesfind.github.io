title: About me

I'm a computational [Data Scientist](https://datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/2374f44a1929076ec438404f79d310f00918cc54) and faculty member at Addis Ababa University with high enthusiasm in expanding computational skills for better research outputs worldwide. I have gained a wide variety of scientific computing techniques such as Programming Languages, Numerical method, Modeling and Simulation,  Network Analysis, Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing(HPC) and interested in the application Electronic Structure Simulation. I'm also passionate and advocate of open source, open access, and open science.

One of the projects, I'm the most excited as founder of a [R-Ladies Addis Ababa](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-addis-ababa/members/) chapter to inspire and train female researcher in the area of data science in Ethiopia. The chapter reached out to different university young researchers to develop their computing skills through social, collaborative learning and sharing. The Chapter also was hosted the first Nasa Space Apps Hackathon 2018 in Addis Ababa which is an international mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in cities around the world.

Since the fall of 2017, I have been working as [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) [Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/),[Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) and [African Task Force member](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html). One of his main concerns is to provide training opportunity floors for researchers and academia to improve their coding and data analysis so that they are able to use research-driven problem-solving techniques. Currently, I have been delivered more than 40+ The Carpentries workshops in Ethiopia and he is keen to continue the effort in the future to address all the demands. Further more, he is excited to share his expertise on [The Carpentries Executive Council](https://static.carpentries.org/governance/) role starting from 2019.
