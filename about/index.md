Mesfin Diro, a seasoned professional in the field of [Data Science](https://datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/2374f44a1929076ec438404f79d310f00918cc54), holds the position of faculty member at Addis Ababa University. With over 8 years of experience, he specializes in the design and research of advanced models and algorithms for Big Data, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Mesfin's academic background includes being a Ph.D. candidate, along with a Master's Degree in Computational Science. His expertise spans various domains such as machine learning, deep learning, numerical methods, modeling, simulation, and high-performance computing.

Mesfin is well-versed in the application of reliable scientific methods to tackle real-world challenges. Proficient in a range of tools including Python, R, PySpark, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PyG ,Streamlit and SQL, he demonstrates his commitment to utilizing the most effective resources. With a keen eye for detail and a collaborative nature, Mesfin excels in optimizing and automating solutions, as well as extracting valuable insights accurately. He is also a certified trainer and instructor for Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, demonstrating his commitment to sharing knowledge and enhancing the skills of others.


Since the fall of 2017, He  has been working as [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) [Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/),[Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) and [African Task Force member](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html). One of his main concerns is to provide training opportunity floors for researchers and academia to improve their coding and data analysis so that they are able to use research-driven problem-solving techniques. Currently, I have been delivered more than 40+ The Carpentries workshops in Ethiopia and he is keen to continue the effort in the future to address all the demands. Further more, he is excited to share his expertise on [The Carpentries Executive Council](https://static.carpentries.org/governance/) role starting from 2019.
